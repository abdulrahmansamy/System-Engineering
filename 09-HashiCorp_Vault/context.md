# Revise the following code to produce a clean, consistent, and production-grade version. Ensure:
- Modular structure with reusable, well-named functions
- Semantic logging with color-coded levels, timestamping, and newline control
- Spinner/dots UX clarity for terminal feedback
- Support for silent mode and verbosity toggles
- Forward stdout to a log file for auditability
- Enable verbosity for commands and forward output to the log file
- Use log file naming convention with timestamp
- Clear error handling with contextual messages
- Consistent indentation, naming conventions, and inline comments for onboarding
- Anticipate edge cases and ensure idempotency where applicable
- Output should be readable, maintainable, and production-ready
