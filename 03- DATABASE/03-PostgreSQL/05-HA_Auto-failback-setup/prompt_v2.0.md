### Objective

Conduct a comprehensive analysis across PostgreSQL communities, technical forums (including Reddit), and expert sources to identify **all critical considerations** for designing a **fully automated, seamless failback system** using `pg_auto_failover`. The goal is to ensure that the **original primary node is safely restored** after recovery, with:

- **Zero data loss** (RPO = 0)
- **Minimal downtime** (RTO < 30 seconds)
- **No manual intervention** 
- **No operational disruption**
- **Automatic split-brain prevention**
- **Consistent state management across all failure scenarios**

Think deeply and exhaustively—leave no detail unexamined. Based on your findings, deliver a **complete English-language design and implementation plan** that includes:

- Configuration for each node (primary, secondary, monitor)
- All required scripts (including systemd units if required)
- Every minor configuration necessary to achieve reliable, automatic failback
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Performance optimization for replication lag minimization

This HA database system should work as if it is a managed database service, operating seamlessly without any human intervention across all failure and recovery scenarios.

### Assumptions & Design Constraints

You may revise or override these assumptions if your research reveals better practices:

- **OS**: Latest LTS Ubuntu Linux (22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS)
  - **Security Hardening**:
    - Implement CIS Ubuntu Linux benchmarks

      - Dedicated SSD disk for WAL files (`/var/lib/postgresql/wal`)
      - Minimum 100GB with separate IOPS allocation
      - Mount with `noatime,noexec,nosuid` for performance and security
    - **Filesystem Preparation**:
      - Create and attach new persistent disk for data to compute instances
      - Format data disks with recommended filesystem for PostgreSQL databases
      - Configure appropriate block size and inode ratio optimized for database workloads
      - Set filesystem labels for easy identification and maintenance
      - Configure disk quotas and usage monitoring
      - Implement automated disk health checks and SMART monitoring
    - **Mount Point Configuration**:
      - Create dedicated mount points with performance-optimized mount options
      - Configure `/etc/fstab` with proper backup, fsck options, and mount priorities
      - Implement comprehensive disk usage monitoring and alerting thresholds
      - Set up LVM logical volumes for future expansion flexibility and snapshot capabilities
      - Configure automatic filesystem expansion when disk space increases
- current status of gcp env:
  - shared vpc, and subnets already created.
  - host projects, and services projects already created.
  - use data resources to get the selflinks/ids of the current existing resources
  - the deployment would be in production database project.
- **Resource Regions**: 
  - Nodes: `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`  
  - Monitor: `us-central1-c`
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 17+
- **Failover Manager**: `pg_auto_failover`
- **Monitoring Node**: Dedicated third node
  - The monitor node must coordinate failover/failback decisions and maintain cluster state integrity using `pg_autoctl`.
- **Read-Only Access**: Optionally enabled on standby
- **Connection Layer**:  
  `[Client Apps] → [GCP Internal Load Balancer] → [PgBouncer] → [PostgreSQL Nodes]`
- **Network**:  
  - Shared VPC architecture in GCP  
  - All PostgreSQL nodes in a single subnet within one service project  
  - Fixed internal IPs assigned: primary, secondary, monitor, and VIP (192.168.24.0/22)
- **Backup Strategy**: 
  - Push regular backups to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
  - Push backups from both nodes (optionally push from standby only to reduce primary load)
  - Implement backup validation and automated restore testing
- **Security Requirements**:
  - TLS encryption for all connections (replication, client, monitor)
  - Service accounts with minimal required permissions
  - Network-level isolation and firewall rules
  - Certificate management and rotation
  - Securely manage passwords and use GCP Secret Manager to store and retrieve credentials
  - Database user authentication via SSL certificates and SCRAM-SHA-256
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Must be included in the design
  - All failover/failback events, role transitions, and replication states must be logged for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Replication lag < 100ms under normal load
  - Automatic tuning of PostgreSQL parameters for HA workload
  - Connection pooling optimization to handle failover seamlessly

  - Audit logging and compliance requirements
- **Dependency Management**: Handling of external dependencies (DNS, NTP, monitoring)
- **Upgrade Strategies**: Rolling upgrades without breaking HA functionality
- **Edge Case Simulation Matrix**:

### Validation Requirements

The final design must demonstrate:

1. **Automatic failover** completing within 30 seconds under various failure scenarios
2. **Zero data loss** verification through transaction tracking during failover
3. **Seamless failback** with original primary restoration and role switching
4. **Split-brain prevention** even during complex network partition scenarios
5. **Performance consistency** maintaining <100ms replication lag under normal operations
6. **Operational transparency** with comprehensive monitoring and alerting coverage

### Additional Critical Requirements

To ensure enterprise-grade reliability, the system must also address:

- **Disaster Recovery Planning**:
  - Cross-region backup replication strategy
  - Regional failover procedures and automation
  - Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for different disaster scenarios
  - Business continuity procedures during extended outages

  - Data residency and sovereignty requirements
  - Audit trail completeness and immutability
  - Encryption at rest and in transit verification
  - Access control and privilege escalation monitoring

### Important Revision Note

Ensure all components work harmoniously together without conflicts, creating a consistent and seamless HA database system that achieves the stated objectives. The design should account for real-world operational challenges and provide automation for all routine tasks while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and security standards.
